# Library Management System

## Background of the System

The library management system integrates both physical and digital library operations to provide a seamless experience for users.

- **Physical Library:** Serves walk-in visitors who prefer to browse bookshelves, engage in quiet study spaces, and access printed resources directly.
- **Digital Library:** Expands accessibility, enabling users to search for books, borrow ebooks, and access research materials from anywhere.

This dual-platform approach leverages modern technology to bridge the gap between traditional library services and digital accessibility. The system ensures:
	- Synchronized inventory management to prevent book shortages or duplicate checkouts
	- User-friendly interface for online users to browse the catalog, reserve books, and manage borrowings
	- Digital membership services
	- Real-time updates on book availability
	- Automated reminders for due dates

## Type of System

The library management system is an online system built on an **SQL database** to efficiently manage and support library operations. It leverages a relational database to store and organize essential data:

- Book inventory
- User accounts
- Borrowing records
- Transaction history

The SQL database serves as the backbone, ensuring reliable data storage, retrieval, and management. Key features include:

- Seamless synchronization of book availability
- Real-time updates on checked-out and available materials
